# Topic chosen :- Task 4: ValueEval: Identification of Human Values behind Arguments

We have uploaded a report as well for reference and deeper understanding of the work we have done.

The Colab Notebook with the name "Final_notebook_Task4.ipynb" contains the code for all the models. Name and comments have been provided for each model. To setup the notebook in Colab: 
1. Create a Folder in Colab Notebook with the name **data_dir**.
2. Load the dataset from [Webis-ArgValues-22](https://zenodo.org/record/6855004#.Y5j7yezMK3I) and upload the contents in data_dir.
3. Create an empty Folder in Colab Notebook with the name **ouput** that will store all the prediction files.
4. Create an empty Folder in Colab Notebook with the name **models** that will store all the prediction files.
5. Now run the cells present in the notebook **Final_notebook_Task4.ipynb**.
6. In the BERT cell, you can change the name of the BERT models, update the tokenizer appropriately and its parameters accordingly.
7. In SVM cell too, you can change the parameters accordingly.
